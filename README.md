# Hello!

This is my repo for the **UI Developer Challenge** to calculate the Fibonacci number. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Live Demo

You will be able to see the demo [here](http://leticiarezende.com/nvidia).

## Basic Requirements

First of all, please download or clone this repo.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- NPM
- ReactJS

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Before running this, please change "Homepage" on package.json.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!

## That's all!

Thank you.
